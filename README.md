# Lifecycle Sorter for Android Studio

This plugin sorts the lifecycle methods of an Activity or Fragment in the order that they are called in an application.
  <ul>  
    <li> <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#ActivityLifecycle">Activity Lifecycle</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html#Lifecycle">Fragment Lifecycle</a> </li>
  </ul>

# Usage
<p>You can find the option to sort the lifecycle methods under the Code > "Sort Lifecycle Methods".
All you need to do is place the cursor inside of your class and select "Sort Lifecycle Methods" or use 
the keyboard shortcut control+alt+k. It's as simple as that!</p>

<p>This is my first plugin and thought it would be a handy tool, not only for myself but other Android developers. 
Hope you guys enjoy!</p>
